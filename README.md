# FallingBallSim (Falling Ball Simulation) by Some-Kid-In-Physics

Simulation of a ball falling through air, air resistance accounted for.

It is a simple program, where a user inputs the ball's mass, radius, and the time elasped in order to get a position value and velocity value. Run this im a terminal or command prompt (after compiling) as the output file's name.

Source code given for review, as well as free distribution.
